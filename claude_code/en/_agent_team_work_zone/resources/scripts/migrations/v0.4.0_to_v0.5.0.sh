# migrations/v0.4.0_to_v0.5.0.sh
#
# Migrates a _agent_team_work_zone/ from v0.4.0 to v0.5.0.
#   $1 UPGRADE_DIR  $2 TARGET_DIR   (invoked by upgrade.sh; do not run directly)
#
# Behaviour: full framework-owned overwrite + the usual block refreshes, plus one
# new step for a user-owned file:
#   - resources/ + docs/ overwrite (new scripts, the /broadcast-rule skill and the
#     optional CLAUDE.md sections arrive here; bootstrap.sh, which upgrade.sh
#     re-runs, installs the skill).
#   - Top-level README: FRAMEWORK / RULES / REFERENCE refreshed (the new
#     "Before you start" section is inside FRAMEWORK).
#   - Lead / flat workstation READMEs: RULES refreshed (diff + backup).
#   - Teammate workstation READMEs: TEAMMATE_RULES refreshed (diff + backup);
#     no block yet → left alone. Text above the block is never touched.
#   - _agent_team_work_zone/.gitignore (user-owned): only the patterns that are
#     new in this version are appended, and only those missing. Nothing is
#     rewritten, reordered or removed. No .gitignore → not created (notice only).
#
# Never created, overwritten or deleted here: _agent_team_work_zone/settings.conf,
# <team>_team/RULES_LEDGER.md, TEAMMATE_INFO.json. (CLAUDE.md is bootstrap.sh's: append-only.)
# No schema change.
# Fail-soft: any single file's step can warn + skip without aborting the rest.

print_step "  • New /broadcast-rule skill (team lead): sends a rule change to every teammate and keeps <team>_team/RULES_LEDGER.md, which only that skill creates."
print_step "  • Optional CLAUDE.md sections (message format, plain vocabulary) in resources/claude_md_optional/. They are offered only on a first install, not during an upgrade; to add one: cat _agent_team_work_zone/resources/claude_md_optional/<file>.md >> CLAUDE.md"
