# Upgrade Guide

This guide explains how to upgrade your project's installed `_agent_team_work_zone/` to a new version of the `agent-team-work-zone` repo.

> **Quick version**: in your project root, run `bash _agent_team_work_zone/upgrade.sh` — one command does it all.
> See below for details.

## Check your current version

```bash
cat _agent_team_work_zone/VERSION
```

Version numbers follow SemVer `vMAJOR.MINOR.PATCH`:

- **MAJOR (X)**: breaking architectural changes
- **MINOR (Y)**: new features (new skills / agents / hooks), backward compatible
- **PATCH (Z)**: documentation revisions, bug fixes, fully backward compatible

Before upgrading, review the `CHANGELOG.md` to understand the scope of changes.

## Framework-file ownership inventory

During upgrades, the following files are **framework-owned** (overwritten by the upgrade script):

```
_agent_team_work_zone/
├── upgrade.sh                 ← framework-owned (one-button entry)
├── VERSION                    ← framework-owned
├── CHANGELOG.md               ← framework-owned
├── README.md                  ← partial update (only between FRAMEWORK:START~END)
├── meeting_room/
│   └── README.md              ← framework-owned
├── docs/                      ← framework-owned, whole-tree overwrite
└── resources/                 ← framework-owned, whole-tree overwrite
    ├── skills/
    ├── agents/
    ├── role_archetypes/
    ├── scripts/
    ├── hooks/
    └── settings_hooks_template.json
```

The following files are **user-owned** (the upgrade script must not touch them):

```
_agent_team_work_zone/
├── meeting_room/
│   └── *.md (except README.md)  ← user messages
├── archive/                     ← archived messages
├── <any workstation dir>/        ← all workstations (flat or _team)
│   e.g. secretary/, architect_team/, etc.
│   including TEAMMATE_INFO.json, teammates/, roundtable/, team_recipes/
└── the "Team Members" section of README.md  ← user-maintained roster (after FRAMEWORK:END)
```

### README.md special handling

`README.md` contains both framework content (rules, skill list, etc.) and user content (the team members table). The framework content is delimited by HTML comment markers:

```
<!-- FRAMEWORK:START -->
(framework content, auto-replaced by upgrade script)
<!-- FRAMEWORK:END -->

## Team Members
(user content, never touched by upgrade script)
```

The upgrade script only replaces content between `FRAMEWORK:START` and `FRAMEWORK:END`; the members table and content after `FRAMEWORK:END` are fully preserved. If your `README.md` has lost these markers, the script will print a warning and **skip** README replacement.

**Exception: the rules section.** `<!-- RULES:START --> … <!-- RULES:END -->` is a **second, independently framework-managed sub-block** nested inside the user area (as of v0.3.2): on upgrade it is **diffed** against the new template, and only replaced — after backing up the old block to `README.md.rules.bak.<timestamp>` — when the content actually differs; everything else in the user area (the members table, custom sections) is still never touched. If your README doesn't have this marker pair yet, the migration locates the rules section by its heading and injects it automatically (skipped if not found).

## How to upgrade

### Recommended: one-button script

In your project root (the one containing `_agent_team_work_zone/`), run:

```bash
bash _agent_team_work_zone/upgrade.sh
```

The script will:
1. Download the latest framework tarball from GitHub main branch to a temp directory
2. Extract and copy the template into the `_agent_team_work_zone/.upgrade/` staging area
3. Invoke the migration-chain dispatcher to run all necessary migrations (incremental upgrade with mid-chain resume support)
4. Auto re-run `bootstrap.sh` to refresh `.claude/skills` / `.claude/agents` / `.claude/settings.json` hooks
5. Clean up the staging area (preserves `.upgrade/README.md` as the directory placeholder)

**Zero arguments, zero config files, zero residue.** On failure, exits non-zero and preserves staging for debugging; the temp download dir is auto-cleaned by an EXIT trap.

### Fork users

If you're running a fork of `agent-team-work-zone`, override the download source with an env var:

```bash
export UPGRADE_REPO_URL="https://github.com/<your-fork>/agent-team-work-zone/archive/refs/heads/main.tar.gz"
bash _agent_team_work_zone/upgrade.sh
```

### Old 4-step flow (deprecated but still works)

The **manual 4-step flow is not recommended**. But `resources/scripts/upgrade.sh` (the migration-chain dispatcher) is preserved — the new one-button script is just its automation wrapper. If you need to run it manually for debugging or customization:

```bash
# 1. Clone agent-team-work-zone repo locally
git clone https://github.com/anonymous/agent-team-work-zone.git /tmp/agent-team-work-zone

# 2. Copy template into your project's .upgrade/ staging area
cp -r /tmp/agent-team-work-zone/claude_code/zh/_agent_team_work_zone/. \
      _agent_team_work_zone/.upgrade/

# 3. Run the dispatcher (same one the one-button script invokes)
bash _agent_team_work_zone/.upgrade/resources/scripts/upgrade.sh

# 4. The dispatcher auto-cleans the staging area (preserves .upgrade/README.md)
```

Regular users no longer need this path — the one-button script is fully equivalent.

## How to roll back

An upgrade is essentially a file overwrite. To roll back, restore via Git:

```bash
cd /path/to/your/project
git diff _agent_team_work_zone/                              # see what the upgrade changed
git checkout HEAD -- _agent_team_work_zone/resources/        # roll back resources/
git checkout HEAD -- _agent_team_work_zone/docs/             # roll back docs/
git checkout HEAD -- _agent_team_work_zone/README.md         # roll back README framework section
git checkout HEAD -- _agent_team_work_zone/VERSION _agent_team_work_zone/CHANGELOG.md
# Or roll back everything (including your own changes — use with care):
git checkout HEAD -- _agent_team_work_zone/
```

After rolling back, if the hooks in `.claude/settings.json` need to match the old version, re-run the old `bootstrap.sh`.

Past releases have annotated git tags (from v0.1.0 onward), so you can `git checkout v0.2.0` to inspect what that release looked like.

## Common failure modes

| Symptom | Cause | Handling |
|---|---|---|
| `curl: (6) Could not resolve host github.com` | Network issue | Check network, retry |
| `✗ Extracted archive does not contain expected VERSION file.` | Corrupted tarball or wrong URL | Verify GitHub repo URL, retry |
| `dispatcher` failed mid-chain | Migration script error | Staging is preserved; debug manually or git-restore and retry |
| `bootstrap.sh exited non-zero` | `.claude/` sync failed | Follow the error and re-run bootstrap manually |
| `## v0.X.Y` already in VERSION file | Already on latest | Exit, no-op |

## CHANGELOG format

Each release adds a `## vX.Y.Z (YYYY-MM-DD)` section to the top of `CHANGELOG.md`:

```markdown
## vX.Y.Z (YYYY-MM-DD)

One-sentence release summary.

### Fixed / Changed / Added / Documentation
- ...

### Migration (vPREV → vX.Y.Z)
**Required**: (actions you need to take during upgrade)
**Behavioral changes to know**: (backward-compatible but worth knowing)
```
