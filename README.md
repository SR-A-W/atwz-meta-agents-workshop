> A persistence and management layer for Claude Code and its Agent Teams.

**TL;DR?** 👉 [Jump straight to Quick Start](#quick-start).

Claude Code makes it easy to spin up powerful agents. But once the scale and lifespan of your work outgrow what a single conversation can hold, a few real problems surface — and the most damaging one has no native fix in Claude Code: **once a teammate vanishes with its process, it's gone for good**. **Agent Team Work Zone exists for exactly this: it organizes scattered, interruptible agent work into a persistent, recoverable, auditable team.** Here is the pain it removes:

- **A teammate agent in Claude Code's Agent Team mode can't survive a process restart, and Claude Code can't recover it.** Claude Code's Agent Teams do not persist teammate sessions: when the Claude Code process stops (say the SSH connection drops, as it often does, or the terminal running it is closed), **the entire team, along with all the working state each member built up, is gone, with no native way to get it back**; you're left rebuilding the team from scratch and re-explaining everything.
- **After `/compact`, detail is lost.** Compaction condenses the conversation into a summary, so an agent's grip on "who am I, what am I doing, what do I owe" **may** get fuzzy.
- **Pile up ad-hoc agent conversations and invisible "agentic technical debt" accumulates.** It works at first, but over time: decisions get trapped in compacted old chats, change ownership blurs, tasks get abandoned, agents duplicate each other's work, and there's no audit trail of "why this was done" — the project gets harder and harder to maintain and review.
- **Hand-off tasks make you rewrite long delegation prompts.** When a task has to pass between conversations, you re-type the background, the goal, and the constraints every time.

**Agent Team Work Zone** adds a **filesystem-based operations layer** around Claude Code's native Agent Teams that catches each of these pains: every teammate continuously persists its state as a **checkpoint**, so after an interruption one command brings each member back from where it left off — **making a long-running agent team that spans days or even weeks finally practical**; roles, notes, TODOs, and exchanges all become files that survive `/compact` and leave an audit trail for every decision, keeping "agentic technical debt" to a minimum; and cross-conversation work flows through structured handoffs and report packets instead of re-typed prompts. It turns scattered, interruptible agent conversations into a **persistent, recoverable, auditable** project team, with you always **in the loop** on the division of labor and documentation.

## What Gaps in Claude Code It Fills

Used on its own, Claude Code falls short in the places below; Agent Team Work Zone fills each one:

| Where raw Claude Code falls short | How Agent Team Work Zone fills it |
|---|---|
| Teammate sessions in Agent Team mode don't survive a process restart — once interrupted, they're gone | Persistent team + teammate workstations, rebuildable one by one from checkpoints |
| After `/compact`, detail is lost and an agent's role and state are reduced to a summary | Role definitions, notes, checkpoints, and TODOs all persisted as files, untouched by compaction |
| Plain conversations can't message each other (only manual copy-paste); in-team messages aren't retained either | Meeting room async file protocol + roundtable records — traceable communication across workstations, sessions, and teams |
| Task state lives only inside a single session | Cross-session TODO / ACTIVE / COMPLETED files |
| Hand-off delegation means rewriting long ad-hoc prompts, with no structure | Structured handoffs and report packets |
| What an agent did leaves no trace, and decisions get buried in old chats (agentic technical debt) | An audit trail + file-based TODO/in-progress/done; plus you in the loop on the labor split and documentation keeps the debt in check |

## Core Idea: Organize Agents Like Real Employees

Without this layer, most people either cram every task into a single conversation, or open a pile of conversations with no clear division of labor — and it quickly becomes unmanageable.

Agent Team Work Zone treats these agents as **real employees**. Under this layer, Claude Code's agent sessions are organized into two forms:

### 🧑‍💼 Solo employee (flat workstation)
An "employee-ified" plain Claude Code conversation session = one employee: a clear **role** and its own **personal workstation** (a persistent directory that serves as its external working notes). It's the same agent you talk to day to day, just with a persistent work area of its own. Plain conversations can't message one another, so flat employees coordinate through the **meeting room** via [async collaboration](#6-make-two-agents-collaborate-via-the-meeting-room).

### 👥 Employee team (Agent Team mode) — **strongly recommended**
For any project with real complexity, we **strongly recommend team mode**. A team = one **team lead** + several **teammates**:

> **One team per complex task; a project can have several teams.** Typically you point **one agent team at a single, sufficiently complex task or feature** — not one team for the whole project. A project can run **several agent teams** in parallel, and different teams likewise coordinate through the meeting room via [async collaboration](#6-make-two-agents-collaborate-via-the-meeting-room).

- The **team lead** is an agent session **with Claude Code's built-in Agent Team feature enabled**. It coordinates — decomposing tasks, routing, reviewing, summarizing — rather than burning its own context window on implementation. It owns a **team workstation** (`*_team/`).
- **Teammates** are specialized workers **auto-created by that Agent Team feature**, each with its own personal workstation — **you don't create or manage them by hand**. In raw Claude Code, these teammates **all vanish when the team lead's process ends**; this ops layer fixes that with checkpoints, **making a long-lived team actually usable**.
- In team mode, **lead↔teammate and teammate↔teammate can talk in real time** — no reliance on hidden chat memory. The **roundtable** is the **documented record and reinforcement** of those exchanges (for audit and recovery), not the only channel.
- Capabilities unlocked by team mode:
  - **Checkpoints** — each teammate periodically persists its working state, so any future spawn can pick up where it left off (this is exactly what lets an interrupted team recover).
  - **Reactivation** — one command rebuilds the entire team from checkpoints.
  - **Team registry + handoffs + archival** — who's on duty, who a task went to, where finished work landed — all traceable.

> Individuals have personal workstations; teams have team workstations. Completed work is **archived** for audit.

---

## Key Primitives

**Workstation** — a persistent directory owned exclusively by any "employee-ified" agent; its external working notebook: role definition, notes, task lists, current working context, and completed-work history. The two role types below each own a workstation.

**Solo employee (flat workstation)** — an employee-ified **plain Claude Code conversation session**: a role and a personal workstation, the same agent you talk to day to day, just with a persistent work area. It does **not** enable the Agent Team feature, so it coordinates with others asynchronously through the meeting room.

**Team Lead** — an agent session **with Claude Code's built-in Agent Team feature enabled**, owning a `*_team/` team workstation. It decomposes tasks, spawns teammates, coordinates the roundtable, and reports to you; it does no implementation. **This is usually the main session you're talking in.**

**Teammate** — a specialized worker **auto-created by Claude Code's built-in Agent Team feature**, with a workstation at `<team>_team/teammates/<name>/` — **you don't create or manage it by hand**. It maintains its own checkpoints, TODOs, commitments, and completed-work log, usually directed by the team lead (you can also talk to it directly).

**Meeting Room** — a top-level async communication space for all flat employees and team leads. Note it **does not sync automatically — it is purely async**: messages don't deliver themselves — you direct **agent A to leave a document for agent B**, then have **agent B run `/check-inbox`** to read what was left for it.

**Roundtable** — a team-internal communication space, used only by a team lead and its teammates (the documented reinforcement of real-time talk, not the sole channel).

**Checkpoint** — a structured state snapshot each teammate writes, letting a future spawned instance recover both "what the previous session knew" and "what it still owes."

**Team Registry** — the `TEAMMATE_INFO.json` maintained by the team lead, which drives the reactivation flow.

## Quick Start

> **Claude Code version**: Agent Team Work Zone requires **Claude Code ≥ 2.1.178** — it adapts to the 2.1.178 agent-teams API (auto session-scoped teams; `TeamCreate`/`TeamDelete` removed). If your Claude Code is **≤ 2.1.177**, use **[release v0.1.0](https://github.com/anonymous/agent-team-work-zone/releases/tag/v0.1.0)** instead (it targets the old agent-teams API). The installer also enforces this floor.

> **Platform support**: currently supported on **Linux** and **macOS**. The install/upgrade scripts and runtime hooks are bash-based; **Windows is not yet supported** (native Windows has no bash — native support is on the roadmap, planned for the next major release). Windows users can run it via WSL for now.

### 1. Requirements

- **Node.js 18 or later**, only for the npm install (option 1). A source install (option 2) does not need Node.js; it needs git, or a ZIP download of this repository.
- **bash**: Linux, macOS, or WSL on Windows (native Windows is not supported)
- **jq** (the setup step uses it to add the framework's hooks to `.claude/settings.json`, and stops without it)
- **Claude Code 2.1.178 or later**

### 2. Install into your project

#### Option 1: npm (recommended)

From your project directory (it must already exist):

```bash
cd /path/to/your/project
npx agent-team-work-zone init --lang en     # or --lang zh for the Chinese edition
```

- This puts `_agent_team_work_zone/` into your project and runs its installer. You can also name the project instead of changing into it: `npx agent-team-work-zone init /path/to/your/project --lang en`.
- Without `--lang`, it shows a language menu when run in a terminal, and uses English otherwise.
- It stops if `_agent_team_work_zone/` is already there. To update an existing install, see [Update the framework to the latest version](#update-the-framework-to-the-latest-version) below.
- If your project already has a `.claude/` directory, the install merges into it. Your own skills and agents are kept if their names differ from the framework's; one with the same name is replaced by the framework's version, with no backup, so rename or back it up first. Hooks on other events are kept, but on three hook events (`SessionStart`, `TeammateIdle`, `SessionEnd`) the framework's hooks replace yours, after `settings.json` is backed up. The [user manual](claude_code/en/_agent_team_work_zone/docs/user_manual.md) explains how to add your hooks back.
- For occasional use, run `npx agent-team-work-zone <command>`. If you use it often, install it once with `npm i -g agent-team-work-zone` and then use the shorter `atwz <command>` (for example `atwz init --lang en`).

#### Option 2: from source (no Node.js needed)

Clone the repository (or download it as a ZIP from GitHub and unpack it), copy the work zone into your project, and run its installer:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/anonymous/agent-team-work-zone.git
cp -r agent-team-work-zone/claude_code/en/_agent_team_work_zone /path/to/your/project/   # or claude_code/zh/ for Chinese
cd /path/to/your/project
bash _agent_team_work_zone/install.sh
```

> **Prefer not to use the command line for the copy?** Do it in your file manager (Finder / Nautilus, etc.): open the cloned repo, **copy** the whole `claude_code/en/_agent_team_work_zone` (or `zh/`) folder, and **paste** it into your project's root directory, then run the `install.sh` line above.

- Copy only into a project that does not have `_agent_team_work_zone/` yet. Nothing stops the copy if one is already there: it overwrites every file it copies in, including the work zone's `README.md` (with your "Project Team Members" section) and `.gitignore`, and skips the upgrade steps. To update an existing install, see [Update the framework to the latest version](#update-the-framework-to-the-latest-version) below.
- If your project already has a `.claude/` directory with content, `install.sh` first asks whether to merge into it (default No; without a terminal it stops and prints the command to finish later). The merge works as described for option 1.
- Later, from the project directory: upgrade with `bash _agent_team_work_zone/upgrade.sh`, and change your install-time choices with `bash _agent_team_work_zone/resources/scripts/bootstrap.sh --reconfigure`.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> **Keep `_agent_team_work_zone/` inside your project directory, and always start Claude Code in that directory** — the directory that *contains* `_agent_team_work_zone/`.
>
> A common mistake is to log in to an HPC cluster (or any server) and start `claude` in your home directory while the work zone sits in a project folder. Then:
> - the project's hooks and settings in `.claude/` are not loaded, and its skills are not available at startup;
> - workstation (each agent's folder in the work zone) paths are resolved from the project root, so checkpoints and reactivation (`/reactivate-team`) look in the wrong place;
> - teammates start in the lead's current directory — if the lead runs in the wrong directory (or its shell has moved into a subdirectory), its teammates start there too and their relative paths fail.
>
> So: `cd /path/to/your/project`, then run `claude`. Using your home directory *as* the project is fine, as long as `_agent_team_work_zone/` is directly inside it and you start Claude there. We still strongly recommend a project-specific agent team work zone inside the project directory, with its own separate Claude Code session.

### 3. What the installer sets up

The installer puts the skills and agent definitions into `.claude/` and enables the required Claude Code settings. On first install it also checks git: if the project is not in a git repository, or is inside one but not at its root, it tells you; at the root of a repository it asks whether to track `_agent_team_work_zone/` in git (default yes, recommended). Answering no adds `/_agent_team_work_zone/` to the project's `.gitignore`; delete that line later if you change your mind. It also offers two optional `CLAUDE.md` sections, a message format for messages to you and a plain-vocabulary rule; both are added by default. All questions are menus (arrow keys and Enter); without a terminal nothing is asked.

#### Track `_agent_team_work_zone/` in git (strongly recommended)

Commit `_agent_team_work_zone/` to your project's git repository together with your code, and don't add it to `.gitignore`. What git tracks is the agents' core working memory: role definitions, checkpoints, work journals, discussion notes and the team registry. Runtime-only temporary files are excluded by the work zone's own `.gitignore`.

- **The agents' working memory and logs are version-managed too.** Checkpoints, work journals, discussion notes and decisions are increasingly an important part of a project's development record. Tracking them in git — especially once pushed to GitHub — means the agents' project memory is managed by git: it is backed up, which greatly lowers the risk of losing it, and it can be rolled back, for example when the agents or the project have gone off track.
- **Easy migration to a new machine.** Clone the project on another machine, run `npx agent-team-work-zone reconfigure` there once from the project directory (installed from source: `bash _agent_team_work_zone/resources/scripts/bootstrap.sh --reconfigure`); it installs the skills and hooks, sets Claude Code up, and asks the install questions again, including the display mode and auto permission mode that are set per machine. Then start Claude in the project directory, and `/reactivate-team` brings back an agent team with the same roles and the same state.
- **Multi-developer collaboration.** Each developer can run one or more agent teams in the same project. The teams learn about each other through the work zone, and communicate or leave messages for each other via `git push` / `git pull` (for example through `meeting_room/`).

```bash
git add _agent_team_work_zone
git commit -m "Track the agent team work zone"
```

> [!CAUTION]
> Workstations can contain sensitive material (paths, hostnames, excerpts of data or conversations). For a public repository, review or scrub before pushing, or keep the work zone in a private repository.

### 4. Start an agent and onboard it

Enter Claude Code right in your project directory:

```bash
claude
```

Then onboard the agent:

```
/onboard help me reproduce the experiments in this github repo
```

> The text after `/onboard` is a description of **what your project is about** — the above is just an example; write it to match your real goal. The skill first asks whether to make a flat workstation or a team lead, then creates the right structure automatically. **For projects with real complexity, choose / let it form a team at this step.**

### 5. Let the team work (checkpoints are automatic)

Usually the team lead forms the team during `/onboard`, per your decision. Just tell it to get going — the lead decomposes the task, proposes teammates, saves a recipe, and spawns the workers.

> **Rare case**: if `/onboard` didn't create a team, just tell the team lead "form a team to do X" and it'll invoke `/spawn-team` (you can call it yourself too, but you usually don't need to).

> **Tip**: in agent team mode, run Claude Code in **"auto mode"** (auto-approve) — teammates trigger a lot of per-action permission prompts, and auto mode spares you from approving them one by one. The installer offers to set this as the default (`permissions.defaultMode:"auto"`, recommended); you can also toggle it anytime with `Shift+Tab`.

**About checkpoints — you don't manage them.** Teammates don't need you to trigger any saving by hand: this ops layer uses a hook to ensure **every teammate automatically writes a checkpoint before going idle** (default interval 15 minutes). A checkpoint captures that teammate's "current-state snapshot + recent work journal" — what it's doing, how far it got, what it agreed with whom, and what it still owes. **It's exactly these auto-persisted checkpoints that let a team be restored after a session is interrupted.**

### 6. Make two agents collaborate via the meeting room

When two agents in **different conversations** need to collaborate (e.g. two team leads), use the meeting room — the async channel. **It does not sync automatically**, so you broker it:

1. **Have the sender leave a document** — in agent A's conversation, say e.g. "Write this conclusion up as a document in the meeting room, addressed to B." A creates a markdown file under `_agent_team_work_zone/meeting_room/` tagged `to: B`.
2. **Have the receiver pick it up** — switch to agent B's conversation and run `/check-inbox`. B scans the meeting room, picks out the documents addressed `to: B`, handles them, and marks each `RESOLVED` when done.
3. **Have the issuer archive** — `/check-inbox` also archives: back in **agent A's** conversation, run `/check-inbox` again, and A (as the document's issuer) archives the now-`RESOLVED` doc, keeping the meeting room tidy.

> When a team lead runs `/check-inbox`, it also scans its own team's roundtable; a flat agent only scans the top-level meeting room.

### 7. Resume and reactivate the team

When you come back, go through Claude Code's normal resume flow, then in the conversation:

```
/reactivate-team
```

The lead uses the team registry and each teammate's checkpoint to restore the team to its previous operating state.

### Update the framework to the latest version

From your project directory:

```bash
npx agent-team-work-zone@latest upgrade
```

- With a global install: `npm i -g agent-team-work-zone@latest`, then `atwz upgrade`.
- Installed from source: `bash _agent_team_work_zone/upgrade.sh` still works (it downloads the latest version from GitHub).
- Only the framework's own files are updated, and the skills and hooks in `.claude/` are refreshed. Your agents' work is not touched: their checkpoints, journals and to-do lists, the documents in the meeting room, the team registries and `settings.conf` stay as they are. (The rules section that the framework maintains inside each agent's README is updated.)
- An upgrade to a new major version asks you to confirm. Without a terminal, add `--yes` (with `upgrade.sh`, set `ATWZ_ASSUME_YES=1`).
- An upgrade does not ask the install questions again: the teammate display mode and auto permission mode keep their current settings, and no optional `CLAUDE.md` section is added.
- **After any upgrade, restart your Claude Code sessions and run `/reactivate-team` for each running team.** Sessions and teammates that were already running may still be using the skills as they were loaded when they started: we have seen running teammates keep following the old `/checkpoint` steps after an upgrade until they were started again.

When a Claude Code session starts in your project, it shows a short notice with these commands if a newer version has been published. The lookup runs in the background at most once a day and never delays the session. Once a newer version has been found, the notice appears from the next session start on, and at every start until you upgrade. If a lookup fails, the version found last time is used; if none has ever succeeded, nothing is shown. To turn the notice off, set `ATWZ_UPDATE_CHECK=0`, or create the file `_agent_team_work_zone/.no_update_check` (commit it to turn it off for everyone on the project).

#### Changing your setup later

To change an earlier choice, after moving the project to another machine, or to add an optional `CLAUDE.md` section you skipped, run from the project directory:

```bash
npx agent-team-work-zone reconfigure        # or, with a global install: atwz reconfigure
bash _agent_team_work_zone/resources/scripts/bootstrap.sh --reconfigure   # installed from source
```

It asks the install questions again on the version you already have; it does not upgrade or reinstall anything. Details are in the [user manual](claude_code/en/_agent_team_work_zone/docs/user_manual.md).

## Built-In Skills

### User-facing skills (you call these — sorted by typical frequency)

| Skill | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `/reactivate-team` | Restore the whole team from checkpoints after a resume |
| `/check-inbox` | Process meeting room / roundtable messages for this agent |
| `/onboard` | Create a flat or team-lead workstation for a new agent |
| `/sync` | Recover role context after compaction and check inboxes |
| `/handoff` | Transfer task context from one agent to another |
| `/promote-to-team` | Upgrade a flat workstation to team lead |

### Automatic skills (agents call these — you usually don't need to invoke them)

| Skill | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `/checkpoint` | (hook-triggered) Update a teammate's recoverable working context |
| `/spawn-team` | Structured 6-phase flow to form a teammate group |
| `/add-teammate` | Add a new teammate to an existing team |
| `/remove-teammate` | Retire a teammate with handoff and archive discipline |
| `/bench-teammate` | Temporarily take a teammate offline to free a slot; reactivate later |

## When to Use It: Complex, Multi-Session Projects

**Best for highly complex projects.** The bigger, longer, more role-heavy, and more traceability-demanding a project is, the more this layer pays off. Specifically, it suits:

- Ongoing projects that span multiple sessions
- Agents with several specialized roles
- Caring about who did what, and why
- Cases where context compaction has caused lost work
- Tasks that need handoffs, tracking, or periodic status reports

---

## Design Principles

**Dedicated notes and memory beat a generic chat context.** Claude Code has its own memory system, but a chat context is often not specific or detailed enough. Writing "what a future agent needs to know" explicitly into workstation files is more reliable and precise than relying on generalized conversation memory.

**A workstation is a working notebook.** Workstation files are an agent's external notebook: current understanding, local knowledge, pitfalls hit, outstanding commitments, and recovery entry points.

**Auto-persist, don't rely on discipline.** A teammate's working state is checkpointed **automatically** by a hook (by default before it goes idle, roughly every 15 minutes), never dependent on anyone remembering to save — this is the underlying guarantee that lets a team recover after an unexpected interruption.

**Human-in-the-loop keeps technical debt low.** Role definitions and division of labor are settled by you together with the agents — so responsibilities are clear *and* you actually know what each agent is doing; and the cross-session meeting-room coordination is something you orchestrate — you decide who leaves a document for whom, and direct agents to write up specific project questions — which drives agentic technical debt down further.

**Low coupling.** Each agent owns only its own workstation. Never edit someone else's files directly — cross-workstation collaboration goes through the meeting room or roundtable.

**A report is a prompt.** A good agent-to-agent report is essentially a high-quality prompt packet: what happened, what was tried, what failed, what changed, what's needed next, and where the relevant files are.

**The team lead coordinates.** The context window should be spent on task decomposition, routing, review, and synthesis — not on implementation.

## In One Sentence

**Agent Team Work Zone is a persistence and management layer for Claude Code and its Agent Teams: it gives AI agents roles, workstations, working notes, reports, handoffs, checkpoints, and an audit trail, so the multi-agent workflows in your project can rebuild knowledge and keep moving after compaction, a session interruption, and resume.**
